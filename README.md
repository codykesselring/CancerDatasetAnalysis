# Breast Cancer Classification
This project aims to use breast cancer data to see if we are able to determine if a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Description
Our dataset comes from kaggle. Since it did not have enough instances, we used the SMOTE algorithm to create more, enough so that we had an even split between malignant and benign. We created 3 different classifiers: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. 

The data is in the cancer.csv file, with the augmented dataset in the cancer_augmented.csv file, both are in the input_data folder. 

Our classifiers and related files are in the mysklearn folder.

The results and data visualizations are in the project.ipynb file.

## Running the Program
